        <h3>Degree or not degree</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The prestige of a university degree shortens the recruitment path considerably. For busy and time-limited HR departments, this is an appreciable factor. Due to the lack of official training in Poland, many professionals have entered the industry via different routes. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">With a very good command of English as a main language of communication, copywriters, teachers or translators can easily enter the world of IT and new technologies. In most companies in Poland so is the case. As non-technicals, they can better understand the needs of the end-user.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, IT testers, analysts, or product engineers can also be comfortable with writing. But what counts are the soft skills, which sometimes determine who gets a job and who doesn't.</p>
        <p>The key to enter a profession is to acquire a set of skills  important for the company. It doesn't matter where. It's important to know the basics well enough to get the job. </p>
