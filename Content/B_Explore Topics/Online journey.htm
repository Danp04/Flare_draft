        <h2>Online activities</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">With the development of technology, many things happen online. Although you can associate the online environment mostly with written activities, today’s reality has revealed the potential of live online events and remote work. High interaction of people on the web encourages the formation of industry sub-groups. The Polish tech comm passionates have also gone viral.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">After the <a href="http://techwriter.pl/">Techwriter.pl</a> portal was created, over time the team decided to set up social media platforms for ongoing communication. The sites are growing in popularity thanks to the interest of more and more followers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techwriter-pl/">linkedin</a>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/techwriterpl">twitter</a>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from linkedin, and twitter, these online groups show a high level of commitment from their members:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PLFUG">Madcap Flare</a> users group</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/tworzeniedokumentacji">Documentation</a> practices-related Polish group created by <a href="http://techwriter.pl/">Techwriter.pl</a> team</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A recently created polish initiative is podcast, <a href="https://techwriterkoduje.pl/">Tech Writer koduje</a> [eng, Tech Writer codes]. It’s  in the Polish native language, and addresses aspects that make the work of tech writers easier.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The online groups can be your starting point in a community development. It’s costs-effective and easy to organize. However, it's more difficult to keep members active. The examples presented above illustrate that many activities, despite the difficulties, are possible when committed enthusiasts come together.</p>
