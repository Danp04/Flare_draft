        <p>Communities of practitioners operate dynamically. They require feeding to grow and thrive. Just as newborn babies. </p>

        <p><b>Act as a leader</b>
        </p>
        <p>All starts with an idea and a vision of a person who wants to turn this idea into reality. You can certainly call him a leader or a moderator. You're, as a leader, responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>identifying the purpose</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> identifying target audience and its needs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>selecting tools</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>sustainable development </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Recruit a team</b>
        </p>
        <p>You will quickly realize that one person is not enough, but two is a team. The next step is to identify and engage practice volunteers that share the same interests. People need to feel that the time and effort they invest in the process is for a specific purpose. Teamwork brings benefits, joy, and self-development. Let your purpose become the team's mission.</p>
        <p><b>Select tools</b>
        </p>
        <p>With the right people nearby, you can think of tools. If you lack a portal specifically for industry professionals, you can create one. With the help of free tools on the internet you are sure to find suitable solution. It is undeniable that you need a server to maintain the portal, but it doesn't cost a lot of money. It's worth using a network of friends among whom you can find additional help.</p>
        <p><b>Get a name, produce a logo, develop content</b>
        </p>
        <p>Think who is your community for, what can bring value to your target audience. It can help you to create a name and a logo of your site. Then comes the time to write. It is up to you whether the website is in the local language or in English. It depends on whether you want to reach local practitioners with your content or go beyond the country.</p>
