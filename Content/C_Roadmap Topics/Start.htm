        <p>Communities of practitioners operate dynamically. They require feeding to grow and thrive. </p>

        <p><b>Make a move</b>
        </p>
        <p>All starts with an idea and a vision of a person who wants to turn this idea into reality. You can certainly call him a leader or a moderator. As the leader, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>identify the purpose</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> identify the target audience and its needs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>plan further activity and grow</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Team up </b>
        </p>
        <p>You will quickly realize that one person is not enough, but two is a team. The next step is to identify and engage practice volunteers that share the same interests. People need to feel that the time and effort they invest in the process is for a specific purpose. Then, teamwork brings benefits, joy, and self-development. Let your purpose become the team's mission.</p>
        <p><b>Select tools</b>
        </p>
        <p>With the right people nearby, you can think of tools. If you lack a space specifically for industry professionals, you can create it. It's not difficult to start blogging. With the help of free tools on the internet, you are sure to find suitable support. </p>
        <p><b>Get a name, write up simple content</b>
        </p>
        <p>Think who your   community is for, what can bring value to your target audience. It can help you to create a name or a logo for your blog. Then comes the time to write. For a good start, choose something simple. You can state who you are and what you are doing. Think of industry-related things, good practices, interesting reference materials, local jargon. Support your ideas visually.</p>
