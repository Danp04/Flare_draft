        <p><b>Plan</b>
        </p>
        <p>From the moment of the official release, plan your further sustainable development. Don't stop at the portal only. Make use of existing social media. Facebook or Twitter are channels that reach a lot of people. </p>
        <p><b>Push and pull</b>
        </p>
        <p>Use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> operating methodology, push and pull dynamics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>push your message through channels and get people interested </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>pull - engage as many practitioners that sustain the mission and spread the message. People appreciate your commitment</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Persist</b> and <b>rely on your team</b></p>
        <p>People, groups, communities have also weaker moments. <a href="http://techwriter.pl/">Techwriter.pl</a> team experienced this first-hand. The path below illustrates what they went through from the very beginning:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Assets/community/stages.jpg" style="width: 588px;height: 256px;">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Chart: stages)</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Having reached a moment of <b>Turmoil</b>, the leader was about to resign. However, the team members didn't stop. They split the duties and continued the stated mission. It worked. 7 years on the market,  around 500 various articles released in Polish, being active in the tech comm scene had a direct impact on sustainability, and personal career development.</p>
        <p><b>Progress</b>
        </p>
        <p>Having overcome difficulties, go on. Think of content that people find interesting. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>publishing job offers at no costs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>knowledge resources</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>interviews with other experts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>information about doc events</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The biggest reward is being noticed. This allows to partner with conferences or large companies. With a rich CV it's easier to get a job not only in the country but also abroad.</p>
