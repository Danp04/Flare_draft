        <p style="text-align: justify;">The prestige of a university degree shortens the recruitment path considerably. For busy and time-limited HR departments, this is a valuable factor. Due to the lack of official training in Poland, people have entered the industry through different routes. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">With a good command of English, as the primary language of communication, copywriters, teachers, or translators can enter the world of IT and new technologies. In most companies in Poland, this is the case. As non-technicals, they can better understand the needs of the end-user.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, IT testers, analysts, or product engineers can also be comfortable writing. But what counts are the soft skills, which sometimes determine who gets a job and who doesn't.</p>
        <p>The key to enter a profession is to acquire a set of skills crucial to the company. It doesn't matter where. It's important to know the basics well enough to get the job. </p>
