        <p style="text-align: justify;">The undeniable benefit of e-learning is access to courses from anywhere and at any time. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">From the business point of view, online training is economical and scalable. Accessible to everyone without secondary costs for travel expenses or course materials. In this way, the Polish tech writers practice as well.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Although the courses don't offer an official degree, they avoid workbook theories and provide on-the-job practices. While most are payable, you can take advantage of frequent promotions or free trial periods.</p>
        <p>The popular platforms are:</p>
